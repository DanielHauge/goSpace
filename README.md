# goSpace

## Setting up Go
To work with your Go project in the most seamlessly way, it should be set up correctly. This is perfectly described in the following video where you're taken through each and every step of the set up.

## How to import goSpace
To import the goSpace into your project, clone the repository and place it in the `src` folder, which is located at the root of your GOPATH.

```terminal
GOPATH/src/
```
Now that the repository has been placed correctly, we can start using the actual framework. This is done by importing the `tuplespace` and `topology` packages into your project. This will like

```go
import (
      "goSpace/goSpace/tuplespace"
      "goSpace/goSpace/topology"
)
```
